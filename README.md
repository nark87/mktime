Introduction to MKTIME: An E-Commerce Website for Watches

* Project Overview
MKTIME is an innovative e-commerce platform focused on the watch market, developed as a final capstone project for Bootcamp CodeSpace - Software Development.
This project showcases my skills and knowledge gained throughout the course, covering areas such as front-end development, back-end integration, database management, 
and responsive design.

* Project Purpose
The goal of MKTIME is to create a streamlined and engaging online shopping experience for watch enthusiasts. 
My website provides users with a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate interface to explore and purchase a curated selection of watches.
From luxury brands to affordable styles, MKTIME aims to serve a wide audience, making the process of finding the perfect watch effortless and enjoyable.

* Features
The MKTIME platform includes a range of essential e-commerce features:

  - Product Catalog: Displays watches with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and filtering options by category.
    
  - User Authentication: Allows customers to create accounts, log in, and make an order.
    
  - Shopping Cart and Checkout: Users can add items to a cart, adjust quantities, and continue with a secure and smooth payment process. Payment is not included!
    
  - Admin Dashboard: Includes tools for administrators to add new products, update products, and delete products.

* Technical Stack
The project leverages a range of technologies, including:

  - Front-End: Built using HTML, and CSS.
    
  - Back-End: PHP for handling requests, managing user authentication, and linking to the database.
    
  - Database: Uses MySQL (based on project requirements) to securely store product, order, and user data.

* Learning Objectives
Through MKTIME, I have deepened my understanding of software development principles, e-commerce dynamics, and full-stack development.
This project also allowed me to practice essential skills like version control, and problem-solving—qualities that are vital in the software development industry.

Next Steps and Potential Improvements:

While MKTIME provides a solid foundation as an e-commerce platform for watches, there are several enhancements I plan to implement to improve the user experience,
scalability, and functionality of the website.

  - Order Tracking and History: Registered users can view their purchase history and track the status of current orders.
    
  - Payment Gateway: Integrated with popular payment services like Stripe or PayPal to facilitate secure transactions.
    
  - Improved Search and Filter Options: Adding advanced filtering and search options—such as filtering by special features (e.g., waterproof, chronograph)—would make it
    easier for customers to find exactly what they’re looking for.
    
  - User Reviews and Ratings: Integrating a review and rating system will allow customers to share their experiences and feedback on purchased watches.
    This feature could help build trust with new users and aid in the decision-making process.
